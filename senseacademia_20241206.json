FPGAs are versatile chips that can be configured to perform specific functions, making them ideal for prototyping complex hardware designs. Emulation refers to creating a software model that mimics the behavior of hardware.  So, an FPGA Emulation Engineer essentially leverages FPGAs to emulate hardware designs, allowing for faster and more efficient testing and verification. System Design Engineer A System Design Engineer is the architect behind complex systems, ensuring all the moving parts work together seamlessly to achieve a specific goal.  They wear many hats, drawing upon knowledge of hardware, software, and engineering principles to bridge the gap between concept and reality. Design Verification Engineer A Design Verification Engineer is the gatekeeper of quality in the world of hardware design. They ensure that the blueprints for electronic devices,  those chips and circuits we rely on every day,  function flawlessly before they are physically manufactured. FPGA Prototyping Engineer An FPGA Prototyping Engineer is the architect and builder in the exciting world of FPGA prototyping. FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are versatile chips that can be configured to act like specific hardware circuits.  FPGA prototyping takes advantage of this flexibility to create functional models of hardware designs before committing to expensive silicon production. Validation Engineer A Validation Engineer acts as the guardian of quality in the development process, ensuring that a product meets all the specified requirements and functions as intended before it reaches the customer.  Their focus can be on software, hardware, or entire systems, depending on the industry and the product being developed. Testing Engineer Testing Engineers possess a keen eye for detail, strong analytical skills, and a passion for finding and fixing problems.  They collaborate effectively with developers and other stakeholders to ensure a high-quality product reaches the market.

FPGAs are versatile chips that can be configured to perform specific functions, making them ideal for prototyping complex hardware designs. Emulation refers to creating a software model that mimics the behavior of hardware.  So, an FPGA Emulation Engineer essentially leverages FPGAs to emulate hardware designs, allowing for faster and more efficient testing and verification. System Design Engineer A System Design Engineer is the architect behind complex systems, ensuring all the moving parts work together seamlessly to achieve a specific goal.  They wear many hats, drawing upon knowledge of hardware, software, and engineering principles to bridge the gap between concept and reality. Design Verification Engineer A Design Verification Engineer is the gatekeeper of quality in the world of hardware design. They ensure that the blueprints for electronic devices,  those chips and circuits we rely on every day,  function flawlessly before they are physically manufactured. FPGA Prototyping Engineer An FPGA Prototyping Engineer is the architect and builder in the exciting world of FPGA prototyping. FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are versatile chips that can be configured to act like specific hardware circuits.  FPGA prototyping takes advantage of this flexibility to create functional models of hardware designs before committing to expensive silicon production. Validation Engineer A Validation Engineer acts as the guardian of quality in the development process, ensuring that a product meets all the specified requirements and functions as intended before it reaches the customer.  Their focus can be on software, hardware, or entire systems, depending on the industry and the product being developed. Testing Engineer Testing Engineers possess a keen eye for detail, strong analytical skills, and a passion for finding and fixing problems.  They collaborate effectively with developers and other stakeholders to ensure a high-quality product reaches the market.

The ability to write efficient, real-time code while keeping memory and power limitations in mind is essential.  Collaboration is key, as they often work closely with both hardware engineers and software developers to create a seamless and secure experience for the end user. Embedded Software Engineer An Embedded Software Engineer is the software architect for those tiny computers we interact with daily - embedded systems.  These are the brains behind thermostats, wearables, smart devices, and even some toys!  They craft the software, or firmware, that makes these devices tick. Testing Engineer Testing Engineers possess a keen eye for detail, strong analytical skills, and a passion for finding and fixing problems.  They collaborate effectively with developers and other stakeholders to ensure a high-quality product reaches the market. Course Curriculum 180 hours of learning 10+ Modules 2+  Projects 10+ assignments Module 1: Introduction to Embedded Systems Module 2: C Programming for Embedded Systems Module 3: Architecture of ARM-Based Controllers Module 4: Hardware and Schematic Design Module 5: Keil Software Exploration Module 6: Embedded C Programming Module 7: GPIO - Understanding & Implementation Module 8: Timers - Understanding & Implementation Module 9: UART - Understanding & Implementation Module 10: Integration of Individual Peripherals Module 11: Real-Time Major Project Implementation Hear from our Learners I joined a 45-day course on VLSI at SSIT, and I must say that my experience has been great so far. The trainer has explained the concepts from the basics, which has helped me to understand the topics clearly. The trainer is very interactive and clarifies all the doubts, making it easier to grasp the subject matter. Additionally, the trainer used different examples to explain everything, which made it even easier to understand the topics. Kandula Naga Praveen Btech, ECE Very useful resources and excellent teaching, gained lot of knowledge related fpga vlsi on SPARTAN 3E board. Done various hands on projects. Done 1 week fpga workshop.
